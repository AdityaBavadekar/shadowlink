# ShadowLink

_Server to access and moniter your PC from anywhere in the world_

- ShadowLink is a secure, remote access server, helping you to access your PC's resources from anywhere via an authenticated web interface.

- Tunneling with **Ngrok** allows global access, while token-based authentication ensures secure connections.


> *Before using ShadowLink, you must read the [Security Notice](#important-security-notice). It contains critical risks and setup requirements â€” skipping it could leave your system fully exposed.*

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaBavadekar/shadowlink.git
   cd shadowlink
   ```

2. **Create `.env` file**

   * On Unix/Linux/macOS:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   * On Windows:

     ```powershell
     copy .env.example .env
     ```
   * Edit `.env` to update:

     * `AUTH_USERNAME`
     * `AUTH_PASSWORD`
     * `JWT_SECRET`

3. **Install dependencies**
   - 1
      ```bash
      pnpm install
      ```
   - 2
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. **Run the server locally**

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   * Server will be live at: [http://localhost:8800](http://localhost:8800)

5. **(Optional) Expose your server via Ngrok**

   Use your preferred method to expose port `8800`:

     ```bash
     ngrok http 8800
     ```

6. **(Optional (Linux only)) Auto start server and Ngrok - Instead of running 2 steps everytime, direct bash script**

   Run the helper script:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

## Important Security Notice

> DO NOT SKIP THIS

**ShadowLink is intended for educational and small-scale personal use only. It is not designed for production or enterprise environments.**

This tool provides remote access and command execution capabilities on your PC. If misconfigured or improperly secured, it can lead to full system compromise. Use with caution.

### Key Security Considerations

* ShadowLink allows remote shell command execution via the `execSync` method. This enables full control of your system from the browser. Improper access can lead to remote code execution.

* Login credentials are stored in plain text in the `.env` file. This file must be secured and never shared or committed to version control.

* The application is not made for public or large-scale use. Exposing it directly to the internet for longer period of time is strongly discouraged.

* A user with write access to the codebase can delete it or modify the application to bypass authentication entirely. File permissions alone are not sufficient security.

### Recommendations

* Use strong, unique credentials.
* Do not run the server with root or administrator privileges.
* Restrict access using a firewall, VPN, or IP filtering.
* Log and monitor all access and command usage.
* Create a dedicated system user with minimal permissions for running this server.

**Use at your own risk. Proper security configuration is your responsibility.**
